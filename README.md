**`QA Analyst`**

Hi! I’m a curious and passionate professional who loves technology, games, and things made with devotion and dedication.
With over 11 years of experience across Marketing, Finance, Research, IT, and Game Production, I’m now specializing in QA (manual and automated testing, Python, Selenium, API, SQL, mobile, etc.). 
I enjoy solving problems creatively, improving processes, and making sure every product delivered meets high-quality standards and provides an excellent user experience.
